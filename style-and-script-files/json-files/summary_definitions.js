All power is relational, and the different relationships either reinforce or disrupt one another. The importance of the concept of power to anti-racism is clear: racism cannot be understood without understanding that power is not only an individual relationship but a cultural one, and that power relationships are shifting constantly. Power can be used malignantly and intentionally, but need not be, and individuals within a culture may benefit from power of which they are unaware.",

RPPs exist in education, justice, child welfare, mental health, and environmental science contexts. RPPs hold promise for making research matter in practical ways and also have potential to address issues of injustice and inequity in education by directly and deliberately working to dismantle these systems rather than perpetuating them. Increased interest in and attention to putting equity goals front and center in RPP work. Importantly, calls for equity in RPP work also have flagged the importance of attending to power differences between and among RPP stakeholders.",
